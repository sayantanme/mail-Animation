# iOSComposeAnimation
Leveraging UIPresentationController, this animation mimics the iOS Mail app's compose animation. This is intended as a code example, not a drag-n-drop library for use in a production Xcode project.

You can find the a great tutorial on UIPresentationController by Sam Davies here:
